		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this assignment, we implemented Bezier curves and surfaces using seperable 1D de Casteljau's algorithm. Additionally, we used the half-edge data structure to implement area-weighted normal vectors at vertices for Phong shading and remeshing operations such as edge flipping and splitting. We also implemented a mesh upsampling method, loop subdivision, to create a higher resolution mesh. 

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>
		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>
			De Casteljau Algorithm recursively subdivides using linear interpolation to calculate a point on the Bezier Curve. In order to implement the recursive step, we calculated the intermediate points by iterating through the control points and interpolating between them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<p>Linear interpolation formula for finding intermediate points:</p> 
				\( (1-t) * p_i + t * p_{i+1} \) 
			<p>where \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) are the control points and \( t \) is a parameter value specified in <code>bezierCurve.h</code>. New points are then stored and returned in a vector.</p> 
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, using 6 control points, we can visualize the intermediate levels towards the final point using the "E" hotkey and the visualize the final curve by pressing "C."

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p> 
			De Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces through the subdivision of control points in first the u, then v direction. This is done by creating a separate <code>evaluateStep</code> method to calculate intermediate points given as Vector3Ds parameters. We then called on <code>evluateStep</code> multiple times, using u as our t parameter to form a row of points. Points retrieved here are then used as control points and v is used as the t parameter to return the final point.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>
			To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we began by finding the three vertices of each face from the provided Half-Edge and calculated a third, perpendicular vector by taking the cross product of the two vectors. We repeated this process for each face and called on the <code>unit</code> method to produce the final area-weighted normal of a given vertex.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
        Since we don't want to flip boundary edges, the first part of our code is a check that just returns the inputted edge if it is a boundary.
        To figure out how to reassign pointers for this part, based on the definitions for the data structures given in lecture, we mapped out how the mesh would look before and after flipping one edge.
        <figure>
            <img src="edgeflip.png" alt="Half-Edge Diagram for an Edge Flip" style="width:100%"/>
            <figcaption>Half-Edge Diagram before and after an Edge Flip</figcaption>
        </figure>

        When we perform an edge flip, this is how the pointers can change. When we initially implemented this method we had a couple bugs so we made this table to minimize the number of pointers we actually worked with. A blue highlighted cell indicates the original pointer changed after the flip and a grey cell indicates that the respective pointer is irrelevant to the problem and does not change.
        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
            <table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align: center;">
                  <img src="halfedges-flip.png" width="400px"/>
                  <figcaption>Pointers for Half-Edges</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td style="text-align: center;">
                  <img src="edges-flip.png" width="400px"/>
                  <figcaption>Pointers for Edges</figcaption>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align: center;">
                  <img src="vertices-flip.png" width="400px"/>
                  <figcaption>Pointers for Vertices</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td style="text-align: center;">
                  <img src="faces-flip.png" width="400px"/>
                  <figcaption>Pointers for Faces</figcaption>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        Clearly, only the half-edges 0-5 are different (at least the way we assigned them), so those are the only ones we should define and change. Since <code>h1</code> and <code>h4</code> only had its <code>next</code> value changed, we set its neighbors first. Then we set <code>h2</code> and <code>h5</code> since we could use the references to <code>f0</code> and <code>f1</code> using <code>h1</code> and <code>h4</code>, and we finished by setting <code>h0</code> and <code>h3</code> last.
        We aren't entirely sure why we needed to define the face pointers to finish this task, but we found that if we didn't, sometimes flipping the edges would cause the face to disappear (summarizes our debugging journey).

            <table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
        Since we don't want to split boundary edges, the first part of our code is a check that just returns the inputted edge if it is a boundary.
        To figure out how to reassign pointers for this part, based on the definitions for the data structures given in lecture, we mapped out how the mesh would look before and after splitting one edge.

            <figcaption>Half-Edge Diagram before and after an Edge Split</figcaption>
        </figure>
        This was slightly more complicated because instead of just reassigning pointers, we had to create new ones. When we did edge flips we tried to minimize the number of objects we had to work with to avoid errors but since we were working with so many new pointers in this step we ended up assigning all the pointers in the diagram above. We first assigned / initialized the pointers.
        After the boundary edge check, we assigned pointers to all the elements we see in the before diagram. Then we initialized the new pointers we would need (1 more vertex, 3 new edges, 6 more half-edges, and 2 more faces). Then we reassigned the values based on what we see in the after diagram. The final step was to set <code>isNew</code> values for the vertices and the position for <code>v4</code> as the midpoint of <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code>.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		In order to implement loop subdivision, we began by calculating the updated positions for the old and new vertices. We began by iterating through the old vertices and storing the new positions into Vertex::newPosition.
		<p>
			These were calculated using the formula:
			<br/>
			<br/>
			\( ((1 - n * u) * original Position + u * original Neighbor Position Sum) \)
			<br/>
			<br/>
			where \( n \) is the number of neighbors (vertex degree) and \( u \) is 3/16 if the vertex has three neighbors and 3/(8n) otherwise. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We defined the new vertex position given 4 vertices, A, B, C, and D as:
			<br/>
			<br/>
			\( (3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)) \)
			<br/>
			<br/>
			To retrieve vertices A, B, C, and D, we looped through the mesh edges and stored our resulting vertex into edge's newPosition. When iterating through both the original vertices and edges, we made sure to set isNew to false. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After finding all the new positions, we iterated through the edges again and called <code>splitEdge</code> on all of the old edges. To do so, we check that both of the corresponding vertices were old. The resulting <code>VertexIter</code>'s newPosition was set to the new position of the edge (retrieved in the previous part). Inside of the <code>splitEdge</code> method, reassigning the new edges as isNew (true or false) was taken care of. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to flip the edges. we iterated through the edges one last time. If the edge corresponded to an old vertex and a new vertex and the edge returned true for <code>isNew</code>, we called <code>flipEdge</code>.
		</p>
		<p>Our final step was looping through all of the vertices and reassigning the vertices <code>newPosition</code> to its <code>Position</code>, promptly setting us up for any future upsamplings.</p>

		<h4>Cube Subdivisions</h4>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="cube6_1.jpeg" width="400px"/>

				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="cube6_2.jpeg" width="400px"/>

				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="cube6_6.jpeg" width="400px"/>
				  </td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			After subdividing, the sharp corners and edges become more rounded and smoother. Additionally, the number of faces and vertices increases, creating a more detailed mesh.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cube is asymmetic after repeated subdivisions since each face only had one diagonal edge (unequal). We can conduct some pre-processing by splitting across the middle of each face and creating a diagonal edge. This way, the cube will subdivide symmetrically.
		</p>
		<p>Given the multi-step process, we found it simpler to break down the individual steps when debugging. For example, when running into infinite loops, we commented out the edgeSplitting iteration and reran to code. When the code ran smoothly, we narrowed down our focus and began checking our logic for the splitting process. This way, we were able to catch smaller bugs in our conditionals and ensure that we were properly assigning isNew throughout each step.</p>
