		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Thoughout this assignment, we implemented a cloth simulation using a mass-spring system and then explored various methods for handling collisions. To do so, we computed the force on each point mass and implemented Verlet's Integration to compute the position of the cloth at each time step. To make our cloth simulation more realistic, we added constraints to the system to prevent the cloth from over-stretching. We also added accounted for self-collisions and collisions against other objects, such as a sphere or plane. Finally, we wrote various shaders such as diffuse, Blinn-Phong, and texture mapping. Bump and displacement mapping were also implemented to add more realism to the cloth simulation.

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		<p>
			The first step of this project was the create the mass-spring grid. Below are some screenshots of the grid with different constraints visible.
		</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<p>
			For the second task, we computed the total force on each point mass and used Verlet's Integration to compute the position of the cloth at each time step. We also added constraints to the system to prevent the cloth from stretching more than 1.1x its resting length. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Once our implementation was complete, we began experimenting with different parameters. When changing the ks (spring constant), we observed that a lower ks value resulted in a looser cloth whereas a higher ks value correlated with a tighter cloth. Below, we have included some screenshots of the cloth simulation with different ks values; the 1,000 N/m cloth has the most stretching (most prominent folds) compared to the default 5,000 N/m and 15,000 N/m cloths. On a similar note, the 15,000 N/m is the stiffest, exhibited by its minimal folds.

			With lower density values, the cloth bounces less due to the lower mass at each point. Visually, it appears lighter as it is able to hang closer to its two pins. Vice versa, the higher density cloth (70 g/cm^2) is heavier and thus, it bounces more. It also hangs lower than the other two cloths.

			In terms of damping, a higher damping value results in a slower cloth falling animation and has less of a bounce. The lower damping values allows for the cloth to fall faster and bounce more (more follow-through after the initial drop).

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p>
			To handle collisions with spheres, we first checked if the position was inside of the sphere by checking the distance between the point mass and the center of the sphere. If the point mass's position is inside the sphere, we determined the tangent point (the point on the sphere closest to the point mass) and then moved the point mass to that tangent point. We calculated how much to move the last position (correction vector) by subtracting the tangent point from the last position. We then added that value scaled by the friction (1 - f) to the current position to get the new position.
		</p>

		</div>
		<p>
			The spring constants of the sphere (ks) also impacted the cloth simulation. For the 500 N/m sphere, the cloth was the stretchiest and had the most folds. The default 5,000 N/m sphere was the most stable and had the least amount of folds. The 50,000 N/m sphere was the stiffest and had the largest/least number of folds.
		</p>
		<p>
			For handling collision with the plane, we followed a similar approach, beginning with a check on whether the point mass's position and last position were on different sides of the plane (took the dot product of the last position or position subtracted by the point against the normal). If they were, then we calculated the distance from the point mass to the plane and then found its corresponding tangent (position subtracted by distance). We also added a small offset to the tangent point to move the cloth up. The offset was reversed if the point mass was below the plane. Finally, we updated the position of the point mass based on the offset + last position + correction vector scaled by the friction (1 - f). Here, we used an LLM to help us with the inside checker code, originally, we were not subtracting by the point, which led to an incorrect distance calculations if our position doesn't intersect with the origin. This interaction helped us better visualize our code and understand the math behind it.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>
			To implement self-collision, we first called <code> build_spatial_map </code> to populate the map with all point masses based on the returning value of <code>hash_position</code>. We then iterated through each point mass and called self_collide on point mass with the provided <code> simulation_steps</code>. For each point mass candidates, we determined the hash by mapping the 3D position to a float. If the hash exists, calculated its direction between the point mass and point mass candidate. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If the normalized direction was less the 2*thickness and the candidate point mass was not the same as the point mass passed in, we would add onto the correction vector, by multiplying the direction by the 2*thickness - direction normalized. We also kept a counter and would increment for each correction added. The correction for each point is then averaged using the counter and scaled by the simulation step before it is added to the point mass's position.

			When varying ks (N\m), we observed that the cloth collides more and contains more wrinkles. The 1,000 N/m cloth has the most folds and is the stretchiest, while the 5,000 N/m cloth is the most stable while the 15,000 N/m cloth is the stiffest.

			When varying the density (g/cm^2), we observed that the cloth with 1 g/cm^2 has the least folds. The 15 g/cm^2 cloth  has less folds and the 100 g/cm^2 cloth is the heaviest and has the most amount of folds.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<p>
			In the graphics pipeline, a shader is a program that works in parallel to compute visual properties like color and lighting effects. Apart from raytracing, shaders are are used to translate input data into a final 4D vector (RGBA) color output for each position, simulating various textures and materials on 3D objects.
			The vertex shader and the fragment shader are the two primary shader types that combine to produce visual realism in OpenGL. For activities like applying displacement maps, the vertex shader changes each vertex's location and normal vectors before passing the updated data onward. After rasterization, the fragment shader uses the interpolated geometry data from the vertex shader to process each generated fragment, which is a sample of pixels. The pixel-level details that show on the screen are created by computing the final color at each position and writing it to out_color.
			Essentially, the shaders control how light interacts with objects which we need for realistic rendering.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Blinn-Phong shading model incorporates three essential lighting elements:
		<br>
		Ambient: This refers to consistent background illumination that softens harsh shadows in poorly lit regions. It provides the object with a baseline lighting and is controlled by the coefficient k_a.
		<br>
		Diffuse: Depending on the angle between the surface normal and the light source, diffue shading uses Lambert's Cosine Law to determine how much light strikes a surface directly. The diffuse component reflects the object's base hue and is independent of the viewer’s perspective.
		<br>
		Specular: Depending on the viewing angle, specular shading creates the illusion of glittering highlights. Blinn-Phong uses the angle between the surface normal and the bisector between the light direction and the view direction. The p value controls the sharpness of the specular highlight and controls the rate at which the highlight deviates from the point of maximum reflection. A narrower and glossier highlight is the result of a higher p value.
		<br>
		To determine the final shaded color of each point on the surface, the three components are first calculated independently and then merged.

		<p>
		Bump mapping gives the illusion of texture on a surface—only an illusion because the actual geometry doesn’t change, so the surface is always smooth, even if the texture looks bumpy. Both the cloth and the sphere exhibit this effect. However, displacement mapping takes things a step further. It changes the object's geometry (the vertices) according to the displacement map. This gives the texture more depth and realism. Furthermore, with Blinn-Phong shading, displacement-mapped objects typically have more noticeable specular highlights since the updated geometry adds more variances in the way light reflects off the surface.
		</p>

		</table>
		<p>
		The small details that differentiate bump and displacement become more noticeable when the resolution increases to 128x128. The displacement-mapped sphere's surface details become more noticeable, and its edges are crisper and more defined. Furthermore, because there are fewer vertices available for adjustment at lower resolutions, displacement mapping may result in noticeable warping or deformation of the sphere's form. At higher resolutions, the sphere also retains its general shape considerably better.

		I recently went to a glass museum over spring break and was inspired to create a shader that mimicked some of the color patterns I saw. Each fragment's distance from the origin is determined by the shader, which then uses sine and cosine (to get high frequencies) functions to produce quickly changing red, green, and blue values. As a result, the glass develops vivid, wavy color bands that extend outward like rainbow ripples. The colors alternate between bright and dark as the radius grows, creating a dynamic and colorful radial effect.
